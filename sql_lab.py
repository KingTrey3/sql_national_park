'''
This is the framework you'll fill out for this assignment.
Each question on the lab corresponds to one of the functions in the LabSuite class.
You should fill out each function so that it returns the desired results from the database.

Because changes to the framework can interfere with the autograding tests,
you shouldn't modify any other parts of the framework beyond those indicated.
